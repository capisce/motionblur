Qt 5 based QML / shaders example

Shows the effect of motion blur on animations.

Use run.sh for the smoothest result, it sets some environment variables that attempt to enable vsync (on NVIDIA drivers) and threaded rendering in the Qt Quick 2 scene graph.

Depends on git://code.openbossa.org/projects/qtquickstyles.git
